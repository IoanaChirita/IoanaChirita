👋 Hi there! I'm Ioana, a 28-year-old technology enthusiast with a background 
in Geological Engineering and a master's degree in Petroleum Geology.

🐍 Currently, I'm honing my skills in Python and exploring the field 
of automation testing.

📚 When I'm not coding, you can find me lost in the pages of a good book, 
strategizing over a chessboard, or planning my next adventure trip. 
You'll often spot me listening to music and dancing around the house 
while I go about my chores 😊.

🌍 Let's connect and share our journeys! Feel free to reach out for collaborations 
or just to chat about technology, books, chess, or anything else that piques 
your curiosity.
